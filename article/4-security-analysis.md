## 4. Security Analysis of SHA-2 and SHA-3

A robust cryptographic hash function must withstand various attack vectors. This section analyzes the security of SHA-2 and SHA-3 based on current cryptanalytic research and theoretical considerations.

---

### 4.1 Security of SHA-2

#### 4.1.1 Collision Resistance
- No practical collisions have been found for **SHA-256** or **SHA-512**.
- The best known collision attacks on SHA-256 reduce security marginally but remain far from feasible.
- Expected work factor for collision attacks: **2^128** for SHA-256 and **2^256** for SHA-512.

#### 4.1.2 Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance
- No effective pre-image or second pre-image attacks are known.
- Best attacks only slightly outperform brute-force (e.g., pre-image attack complexity reduced from **2^256** to **2^251** for SHA-256).

#### 4.1.3 Length Extension Attacks
- SHA-2 is vulnerable to **length extension attacks** because of its Merkle–Damgård construction.
- Mitigation: Use constructions like **HMAC** or protocols designed to prevent misuse.

#### 4.1.4 Side-Channel Attacks
- Like most cryptographic primitives, SHA-2 implementations can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks (e.g., timing, power analysis).
- Countermeasures: Constant-time implementations, masking techniques.

#### 4.1.5 Current Status
- SHA-2 is considered secure and is recommended for most cryptographic applications.
- Collision attacks on reduced-round variants exist but are not practical for full-round SHA-2.

### 4.2 Security of SHA-3

#### 4.2.1 Collision Resistance
- SHA-3 variants maintain a security level of **n/2 bits** for collision resistance (e.g., **128-bit** collision resistance for SHA3-256).
- Sponge construction naturally resists certain generic attacks.

#### 4.2.2 Pre-image and Second Pre-image Resistance
- Best known attacks against SHA3-256 achieve complexities of approximately **2^256** for pre-image resistance.
- No significant weaknesses have been discovered in the Keccak permutation used by SHA-3.

#### 4.2.3 Resistance to Length Extension Attacks
- SHA-3 inherently avoids length extension attacks due to its sponge-based design.
- Unlike SHA-2, the hash output does not reveal internal state information.

#### 4.2.4 Structural Cryptanalysis
- SHA-3 has withstood rigorous analysis during the NIST competition.
- Known attacks target reduced-round Keccak but remain far from practical application on the full-round SHA-3 functions.

#### 4.2.5 Side-Channel Resistance
- Hardware implementations of SHA-3 are efficient and can be designed to mitigate side-channel attacks.
- Sponge structure facilitates simple, secure implementations in hardware and constrained environments.

#### 4.2.6 Current Status
- SHA-3 is considered highly secure with no practical attacks.
- Recommended as an alternative to SHA-2 for systems requiring diversity in cryptographic primitives.

| Length Extension Resistance | Vulnerable (requires HMAC for mitigation)   | Inherently resistant                     |
| Side-Channel Resistance     | Requires careful implementation             | Facilitates efficient, secure implementations |
| Cryptanalysis Status        | Secure with minor theoretical weaknesses    | Secure, no practical vulnerabilities     |

### 4.4 Forward Security Considerations

- SHA-2 continues to be sufficient for most applications.
- SHA-3 serves as a cryptographic hedge against unforeseen SHA-2 weaknesses.
- Both algorithms are standardized and widely accepted in modern cryptography.

The choice between SHA-2 and SHA-3 depends on application-specific needs:
- **SHA-2** is preferable for compatibility and performance in existing systems.
- **SHA-3** is favored for new designs requiring advanced security features and resistance to structural attacks.
