# 1. Introduction to Hash Functions
A hash function is a deterministic algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size bit string, known as a hash value, digest, or checksum. In cryptographic contexts, hash functions play a critical role in ensuring data integrity, authentication, and security.

Unlike encryption, which is reversible with a key, hash functions are designed to be one-way functions, meaning it should be computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input from its hash output.

1.1 What is a Cryptographic Hash Function?
A cryptographic hash function H can be formally defined as a function that takes an input message m of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-length binary output:

H: {0,1}* → {0,1}^n
Where:

{0,1}* represents binary strings of arbitrary length.

{0,1}^n represents binary strings of fixed length n (e.g., 256 bits for SHA-256).

Example:
For example, applying the SHA-256 hash function to the string "Hello, world!" yields:

SHA-256("Hello, world!") =

Regardless of the input length, the output is always a 256-bit digest.

1.2 Essential Security Properties
A secure cryptographic hash function must satisfy several fundamental properties:

1.2.1 Preimage Resistance
Given a hash value h, it should be computationally infeasible to find any input m such that:

H(m) = h
1.2.2 Second Preimage Resistance
Given a specific input m1, it should be computationally infeasible to find another input m2 ≠ m1 such that:

H(m1) = H(m2)
1.2.3 Collision Resistance
It should be computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs m1 ≠ m2 such that:

Copy
Edit
H(m1) = H(m2)
1.2.4 Avalanche Effect
A minor change in the input (e.g., flipping a single bit) should result in a completely different and unpredictable hash output.

1.3 Applications of Cryptographic Hash Functions
Hash functions are widely used in many cryptographic and security systems:

Data Integrity Verification: Ensuring that data has not been tampered with (e.g., file checksums).

Digital Signatures: Hashing data before signing to ensure authenticity.

Message Authentication Codes (MACs): Providing data integrity and authentication between communicating parties.

Password Hashing: Storing hashed (and salted) passwords to protect user credentials.

Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies: Used in proof-of-work mechanisms, transaction validation, and block mining.

Commitment Schemes: Enabling verifiable commitments to data while keeping it hidden.

1.4 Difference Between Hashing and Encryption
Feature	Hashing	Encryption
Output Size	Fixed-length	Variable (depends on input & padding)
Reversibility	Irreversible (one-way function)	Reversible with a decryption key
Use Case	Integrity, authentication, fingerprints	Confidentiality, data protection
Security Goal	Collision & preimage resistance	Confidentiality & secrecy

1.5 The Importance of Hash Length (n)
The security of a hash function depends on the size of its output n:

Preimage resistance strength ≈ 2^n operations.

Collision resistance strength ≈ 2^(n/2) operations (due to the birthday attack).

For example:

SHA-1 (160-bit output): Collision resistance ≈ 2^80.

SHA-256 (256-bit output): Collision resistance ≈ 2^128.

As computational capabilities grow, longer hash outputs are required for continued security.
